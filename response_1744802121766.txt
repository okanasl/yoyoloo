Thought: Now that I have the initial tech environment, I need to create a dynamic video sequence showing code transformation and NextJS capabilities. Let me create a video that shows the code environment coming to life with dynamic transitions.

Action: reference-to-video
Action Input: {
    "prompt": "A dynamic sequence showing holographic code projections animating and floating in space, with smooth camera movement from left to right, focusing on different code screens. The blue and purple holograms pulse with energy, showing the speed and efficiency of development. The scene should feel high-tech and futuristic.",
