Thought: Now I need to create a final video sequence that shows the NextJS logo animating and integrating with our tech environment, followed by updating the canvas timeline state with all our media elements properly arranged.

Action: reference-to-video
Action Input: {
    "prompt": "A dynamic logo reveal animation where the NextJS logo emerges from the tech environment, with smooth transitions and particle effects. The logo should appear to materialize from the holographic code elements, with elegant motion and professional polish. Camera slowly zooms in as the logo becomes more prominent.",
