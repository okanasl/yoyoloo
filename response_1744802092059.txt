Thought: I'll create a dynamic and engaging 8-second advertisement for NextJS that showcases its speed, versatility, and modern web development capabilities. Let me break this down into a plan:

1. Create a sleek, modern tech environment with code elements
2. Show a quick transformation/build process
3. Add the NextJS logo reveal
4. Include appropriate sound effects and background music
5. Ensure smooth transitions between scenes

Let me start by generating the initial tech environment image.

Action: generate_image
Action Input: {
    "prompt": "A futuristic, minimalist developer workspace with holographic code projections floating in dark space. Multiple transparent screens showing React code, with a subtle blue and purple color scheme. Clean, high-tech aesthetic with depth and dimension. No text or logos visible.",
    "style": "photorealistic",
    "image_size": "landscape_16_9"
}
