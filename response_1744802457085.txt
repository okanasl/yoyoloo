Thought: Now that we have all the media elements, I need to create a final video that combines the tagline with our tech environment and then update the canvas timeline state to arrange all elements properly for the 8-second advertisement.

Action: reference-to-video
Action Input: {
    "prompt": "A dynamic sequence where the text 'Build Fast. Ship Faster.' appears with a sleek animation, floating over the tech environment. The text should emerge with a modern, digital effect, integrating smoothly with the holographic elements. Professional motion graphics style with smooth transitions.",
    "reference_image_urls": ["https://fal.media/files/zebra/hBJ1htfZL81CeWaCSZDH3_image.jpg", "https://fal.media/files/penguin/efqhE_uxrCfk5iFvO8J9v_image.jpg"]
