Notes:

- Please make sure to have at least ~3$ in fal ai credits and ~1$ Anthropic credits. The agent will generate 7 seconds scene(s) by default unless you prompt otherwise.
- Video generation may take long on fal.ai side, please wait a bit.
- Currently messages are not stored. So, when you refresh the page, you won't see them again. Video assets are stored tho.
- Provided credentials in UI are not being stored/logged anywhere except memory when needed.
- Download button on right section of timeline will create mp4 file for you to download the output after generation.
- Manual editing is limited but you can drag on timeline for timing and canvas on the center for positioning.
- There's no user, so the scenes that you generated are publicly accessible on demo website.
- You can check an example output in `test_output` folder.
